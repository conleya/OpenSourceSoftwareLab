It is most likely that I will contribute to an existing project, and 
therefore not be able to choose the organizational structure directly.
I as of yet have not thoroughly gone through the list of RCOS projects
but plan to do so sometime this week.  Currently I am working on the 
public project [metpetdb](https://github.com/metpetdb), but would like
branch into potentially a low level application (given that the required
knowledge is in reach) or potentially something in bioinformatics.


As for the organizational structure of my project, a shared repository in 
a small group would probably be the most educational experience. Having a 
space where I can and will make mistakes will leave me better informed 
about how github and version control work in action, but more importantly, 
why etiquettes are the way they are.  Otherwise, a blessed repository with 
integration manager would be ideal, giving me essentially a supervisor to 
be directly critical of my work and ensure I learn to follow etiquette, and 
have a better chance of leaving me with an understanding a community.
